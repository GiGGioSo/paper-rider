# PaperRider features
- 2 basic campaing levels
- ability to create custom levels

When creating a custom map, a file with an automatic name will be generated under the folder `custom_maps\`.
If you want to change the name that appears in the in-game menu, then open the file and replace the first word with a name of you choice (**IT CANNOT CONTAIN SPACES**).

**If you create a cool custom map, DM me on discord (@wol_low_5995) so that I can include it as a campaign map in the next release.**
